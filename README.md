### Hi nerds 👋
I am David, I am currently working as a Product Owner but started out as an full stack developer with Javascript and PHP.
I have also learned some Java on the path to be a Product Owner. 

Today I am developing some private Node.js/React apps with diffrent types of databases.

- ⌨️ I’m currently working on a new React app using Gatsby.
- 📘 I’m currently learning Gatsby and Apollo Server.
- ❔ Ask me about React, Redux, Nest.js stuff.
- 🍔 Fun fact: I started out to be a chef but switched to be a developer, so food is my thing anyway.
- 📫 How to reach me: [@dsouthmountain](https://twitter.com/dsouthmountain) (Twitter)

glhf, David 😄
